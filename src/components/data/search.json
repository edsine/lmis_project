This series is based on the 13th ICLS definitions. For time series comparability, it includes countries that have implemented the 19th ICLS standards, for which data are also available in the Work Statistics -- 19th ICLS (WORK) database. The working-age population is commonly defined as persons aged 15 years and older, but this varies from country to country.
